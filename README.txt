This is the README file for all figure 30.13 work


the task was split into two notebooks all the resources for the color model can be found in Color_model folder and all the resources for the shape model can be found in Shape_model folder. I built and trained both models locally on my own GPU so the notebooks are currently set up with hard coded file paths. I will go back and fix that when i have the time.


TODO: 
	1. change the noteboooks so all hard coded file paths have one declaration location for ease of changing.
	2. Continue to train the color model for more steps. It is having some difficulty with the color purple.
